# Author Photos

Place author headshot photo here for use on book back covers and marketing materials.

## Expected File

- **`author-headshot.jpg`** — Professional headshot (AI-enhanced from real photo recommended)

## Technical Requirements

- High resolution (minimum 300 DPI at print size)
- Clean background, uncluttered
- JPEG or PNG format
- Minimum 600 x 800 px (will be scaled for back cover use)
- Same photo used across all 8 volumes for series consistency

## Photo Style Guide

Given the subject matter (healing from narcissistic abuse, personal sovereignty) and the audience (emotionally sensitive adults seeking recovery), the photo should communicate **trust, warmth, and lived experience** — not corporate polish.

### Framing

- Head-and-shoulders crop (not full body)
- Slightly off-center composition — more natural and inviting than centered/corporate
- Shot from chest up, allowing breathing room around the head

### Expression & Energy

- Soft, genuine smile — approachable but grounded (not performative)
- Direct eye contact with the camera — builds trust, critical for readers who've experienced betrayal
- Relaxed posture — conveys someone who's done the work, not someone posing

### Background

- Clean and uncluttered
- Natural/warm tones — soft greenery, warm neutrals, or a slightly blurred natural setting (Costa Rica connection is a differentiator)
- Avoid pure white studio backgrounds — they feel clinical for this genre

### Lighting

- Natural light or soft diffused light
- Golden hour or open shade produces the warmest, most flattering results
- Avoid harsh shadows or overhead lighting

### Wardrobe

- Solid, warm colors (earth tones, soft blues, muted greens)
- Avoid busy patterns — they distract at small print sizes on the back cover
- Simple neckline — the reader's eye should go to the face

### What to Avoid

- Overly glamorous or filtered shots — readers in this genre value authenticity
- Sunglasses, hats, or anything hiding the eyes — eye contact = trust
- Group photos cropped down — they always look awkward
- Low-resolution phone selfies — even with AI enhancement, the source needs decent quality

## Back Cover Placement

The back cover layout places the author photo and bio side by side in the lower section:

```
[Author Photo]  [Author Bio]
 (headshot)     (50-75 words)
 Left-aligned   bio wraps right
```

This is the standard nonfiction convention — readers' eyes scan left-to-right, so the photo anchors the section and the bio flows naturally. See `book/release/15-designer-brief.md` for full back cover specifications.

## AI Enhancement Notes

AI enhancement works well as long as the base photo has good lighting and composition. AI can clean up background, adjust color balance, and sharpen — but it can't fix a bad angle or forced expression. Start with the best natural photo possible.

## Usage

Referenced by `book/release/15-designer-brief.md` for the back cover layout of all 8 volumes of The Sovereignty Series.
