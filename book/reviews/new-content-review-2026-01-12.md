## Review Summary

### Bailey (Beta Reader) - Reader Engagement

**Overall Assessment:** Content will land powerfully for target audience. Voice is consistent, emotionally resonant.

**Key Strengths:**
- Opening hooks are excellent ("Not all violence leaves bruises")
- Distinction between expression and attack is concrete and validating
- "Make-Up Trap" neurochemistry explanation will resonate deeply
- Field Notes provide specificity without being voyeuristic

**Priority Recommendations:**
1. Strengthen visual treatment of key reframes ("The make-up is not repair")
2. Signal "When You're the Receiver" section earlier in Vol 3 Ch 6
3. Add acknowledgment before dealbreaker list for readers who stayed

### Sage (Sensitivity Reader) - Representation & Accessibility

**Overall Assessment:** Strong trauma-informed awareness throughout. Well-calibrated dual accountability.

**Key Strengths:**
- Repeated validation of somatic responses
- "Understanding is not permission" framing prevents excuse-making
- Non-gendered core framework language

**Priority Recommendations:**
1. **High:** Use "grown-ups" instead of "Mommy and Daddy" (Vol 5)
2. **Medium:** Vary pronouns in field notes to avoid gendered patterns
3. **Medium:** Add nuance distinguishing cultural directness from abuse

### Felix (Fact-Checker) - Accuracy Verification

**Overall Assessment:** Content demonstrates strong alignment with established research.

| Status | Count |
|--------|-------|
| VERIFIED | 12 |
| VERIFIED (with caveat) | 1 |
| SUGGESTION | 1 |

**Verified Claims:**
- Gottman research on contempt predicting relationship failure
- Cortisol response to verbal threats
- Trauma bond formation through fear/relief cycles
- Children's physiological responses to conflict
- Disorganized attachment description
- ACE study health correlations

**Suggestion:**
1. Add brief explanation for "mirror neurons" reference (Vol 5, line 452) - Mirror neurons are brain cells that fire both when we perform an action and when we observe someone else performing that action. While the specific mechanisms are still being researched, the concept helps explain how children's nervous systems can "absorb" the emotional states of adults around them.
2. "Verbal violence" terminology may benefit from definition or sourcing

### Lydia (Line Editor) - Prose Craft

**Overall Assessment:** Writing is generally strong with consistent voice. Suggestions are refinements, not corrections.

**Key Findings:**
1. Vary sentence openings in "Signs Language Has Become a Weapon" list
2. Add transition at start of "Relational Cascade" section
3. Convert cumulative abuse list from bullets to prose (Vol 1, lines 190-195)
4. Replace vague "texture" with "consequences" (Vol 3, line 439)
5. Tighten one-line anchor phrase (Vol 3, line 715)
6. Reduce repetition of "buffer" (7x in one section)

---

### Clara (Copy Editor) - Consistency & Style

**Overall Assessment:** Well-written with consistent punctuation and accurate cross-references.

**Corrections Needed:**
1. Missing article: "when buffer is empty" → "when **the** buffer is empty" (Vol 3, line 440)
2. Add hyphens: "Early relationship:" → "Early-relationship:" (Vol 1, lines 295-297)

**Style Observations:**
- Capitalized "AND" for emphasis is used consistently (intentional)
- Date reference "2024" may need updating for publication (Vol 3, line 977)
- All cross-references verified accurate

---

### Petra (Proofreader) - Final Polish

**Overall Assessment:** Content is in excellent shape. Two grammatical issues should be corrected.

**Fix Immediately:**
1. "more good" → "even better" or "better" (Vol 1, line 335)
2. Missing comma: "...over-bridge difference**,** discovering it no longer wants to" (Vol 3, line 315-316)

**Optional Polish:**
- Hyphenation: "counter-attack" → "counterattack" (Vol 3, line 484)
- "vs." in heading could be "Versus" for consistency (Vol 1, line 272)
- Consider italicizing *disorganized attachment* on first use (Vol 5, line 464)
