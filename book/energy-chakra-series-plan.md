# The Energy Series: A Comprehensive Plan

## Series Vision

**Working Title:** *The Energy Series* (or *The Field Series*)

**Tagline:** *"You are not just in a body—you are a field. Learn to read it, clear it, and protect it."*

**Core Philosophy:** Energy is not metaphor—it is measurable, manageable, and yours to master. This series bridges ancient wisdom with modern neuroscience, teaching readers to become conscious stewards of their energetic reality.

## Series Arc: The Progressive Journey

Following the Sovereignty Series model, The Energy Series moves through a natural progression:

| Vol | Title | Arc Word | One-Line Decoder |
|-----|-------|----------|------------------|
| 1 | **The Field** | SENSE | "Your body has been telling you the truth. You just weren't taught to listen." |
| 2 | **The Centers** | UNDERSTAND | "Each center holds a question. Coherence is your answer." |
| 3 | **The Cleanse** | CLEAR | "What doesn't belong in your field didn't originate there." |
| 4 | **The Fuel** | NOURISH | "Everything you consume becomes you—choose consciously." |
| 5 | **The Frequency** | ATTUNE | "You don't attract what you want. You attract what you emit." |
| 6 | **The Circle** | PROTECT | "Your field doesn't need walls—it needs discernment." |
| 7 | **The Space** | SANCTIFY | "Your home is an extension of your field. Treat it as sacred." |
| 8 | **The Flow** | RADIATE | "You were never meant to contain your light. You were meant to share it." |
