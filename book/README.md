## Core Philosophy

All eight books share these principles:

1. **You were never the problem.** The patterns you adapted to survive are not character flaws.

2. **Naming creates power.** When you can name what's happening, it stops happening to you and starts happening in front of you.

3. **The body keeps the score.** Healing requires nervous system work, not just insight.

4. **Secure attachment is learned.** It's a skill you can develop, not something you either have or don't.

5. **Compassion without self-abandonment.** You can hold compassion for others while still protecting yourself.

6. **Sovereignty is not separation.** It is self-trust without urgency.

7. **Your presence is your power.** When you stop managing your impact and start trusting yourself, everything changes.

8. **Breaking the chain is possible.** You can give others what you never received.

9. **Thriving is not betrayal.** You are allowed to build a beautiful life.
