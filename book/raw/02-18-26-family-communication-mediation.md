# Raw: The Go-Between — When Divorce Made Me the Messenger

**Date:** February 18, 2026
**Topic:** Parentification through divorce — being used as a communication conduit between parents
**Related:** Vol 1 Ch 7 (Triangulation), Vol 2 Ch 4 (Parentified Child), Vol 5 Ch 11 (Co-Parenting)

## The Experience

My parents after divorce wouldn't speak and used me as a go-between to converse about everything from money to schedules.

---

## What This Actually Was

This is one of the clearest forms of **post-divorce parentification through triangulation** — not the dramatic kind where a child is weaponized or turned against a parent, but the quiet, functional kind where a child becomes the family's communication infrastructure.

When two adults refuse to speak to each other but still need to coordinate a shared life — finances, schedules, holidays, logistics — someone has to carry those messages. And when the only person both parents will talk to is their child, that child becomes a living telephone line between two people who chose silence over discomfort.

## The Mechanics

**What it looked like from the outside:**
- "Tell your father the check is late."
- "Ask your mom what time she's picking you up Friday."
- "Let your dad know I changed the insurance."
- "Can you find out from your mother if she's taking you for Christmas?"

**What it felt like on the inside:**
- Every message carried weight it shouldn't have
- The money conversations were the worst — carrying financial tension between two adults who refused to negotiate directly
- Schedule coordination meant being responsible for logistics no child should manage
- Every relay was a loyalty test disguised as a practical request
- You become hypervigilant about tone — *how* to deliver the message so it doesn't start a fight you'll be in the middle of
- You learn to edit, soften, translate — becoming a diplomat before you understand what diplomacy costs

## The Invisible Promotion

No one sits you down and says, "You are now the family mediator." It happens gradually:

1. First, they stop talking to each other
2. Then, small requests: "Just mention to your dad..."
3. Then, bigger ones: "Tell your mother I can't do the 15th..."
4. Then, financial ones: "Ask your father about the support payment..."
5. Then, it's just how things work — you are the channel

By the time you realize what's happened, it's been your job for years. You didn't apply for it. You didn't consent to it. But stopping feels like you'd be the one breaking the family.

## What It Teaches You (That You Have to Unlearn)

- **That you are responsible for other people's communication** — If you don't carry the message, it doesn't get delivered. The system depends on you.
- **That direct conflict is so dangerous even adults can't do it** — If your parents can't talk to each other, what hope do you have of ever being direct?
- **That your needs come last** — The message is always more important than how carrying it makes you feel.
- **That love means being useful** — You matter because you're the bridge. Without the function, who are you?
- **That you must be neutral at all costs** — Taking sides means losing a parent. So you learn to flatten yourself.
- **That money is a weapon or a wound** — Carrying financial messages between parents teaches you that money is never just money. It's leverage, resentment, control, and pain.

## The Adult Pattern

Children who served as the family go-between often become adults who:

- Over-function in communication — managing relationships between others, translating, softening, bridging
- Feel anxious when people around them aren't communicating
- Automatically step into mediator roles at work, in friendships, in partnerships
- Struggle to stay out of conflicts that aren't theirs
- Have complicated relationships with money that echo the financial messages they carried
- Feel responsible when relationships around them fail ("If I had just said it differently...")
- Find rest threatening — because when you stop bridging, the system collapses
- Choose partners who need them to manage communication with others (recreating the role)

## The Decoder

> "I was not a messenger. I was a child who deserved parents who could speak to each other."

> "Their silence was not my responsibility to fill."

> "Carrying messages about money between two adults was never my job — and the weight of it shaped how I relate to money, conflict, and my own worth."

## Integration Notes

This experience maps directly to:
- **Vol 1, Ch 7** — Triangulation: the child-as-communication-channel variant
- **Vol 2, Ch 4** — The Parentified Child: "Regulated parents' emotions or managed household functioning"
- **Vol 5, Ch 11** — Triangulation and Message-Passing: "Tell your mother that..." / "Ask your dad if..."
- **Vol 5, Appendix A** — Mediator/Truth Holder Role: "A family role where one child becomes the go-between for parents who won't speak directly"

### What's Missing From the Current Text

The existing content covers triangulation as a *tactic* (something a narcissistic co-parent does) but doesn't fully explore the experience from the child's perspective — especially the **mundane, daily, grinding** quality of it. It wasn't dramatic. It wasn't explosive. It was just... your job. Every day. Money, schedules, logistics. The banality of it is what makes it so insidious — because how do you name something as harmful when it just looks like "helping"?

The current Parentified Child section (Vol 2, Ch 4) captures the emotional caretaking dimension but doesn't address the **communication labor** dimension — the child who isn't regulating emotions but literally serving as the communication medium between two adults.

### Proposed Addition: "The Human Telephone" Subsection

**Target:** Vol 5, Ch 11 — after the existing "Triangulation and Message-Passing" section (line 476)

A subsection that shifts from the parent's perspective (how to stop triangulating) to the **child's lived experience** — for adult readers recognizing themselves in this pattern. Including:

1. The gradual escalation from small requests to full communication dependence
2. The specific harm of carrying financial messages
3. The neutrality trap — how being the go-between forces identity erasure
4. The adult legacy: over-functioning communicators who can't rest
5. Field note based on this experience
