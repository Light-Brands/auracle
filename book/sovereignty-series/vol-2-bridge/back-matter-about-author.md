Jennifer Brooke Lawless is a therapeut, writer, and survivor of narcissistic abuse. She holds degrees in Psychology (Boston University) and Mental Health Counseling (Nova Southeastern University), with clinical experience spanning psychiatric units, family therapy, and couples counseling.

In *The Narcissism Decoder* (Volume 1), she helped readers name the patterns. Now, in *The Bridge*, she guides you across the gap between insight and embodiment—because she had to cross it herself.

After recognizing her own patterns, Jennifer discovered that understanding wasn't enough. Her body still reacted. Guilt still pulled her back. She knew the patterns intellectually but couldn't stop living them.

What followed was years of nervous system work, shadow integration, and the slow practice of building secure attachment from the inside out. Not through more analysis—but through training.

She wrote *The Bridge* because she needed it. Because insight alone hadn't healed her. Because the book that bridged understanding and embodiment didn't exist—so she created it.

She now lives in Costa Rica, where she offers healing sessions and integration work through Light Brands and Light Field Institute.
