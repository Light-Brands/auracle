# Chapter 7: Family Roles & Triangulation

## When Manipulation Is Your Origin Story

---

This is the hardest chapter.

If you grew up in a family with narcissistic dynamics, manipulation isn't something that happened to you—it's the water you swam in. You may not have known there was any other way to relate.

The patterns in this chapter might feel like home. That's both the problem and the key to freedom.

## Why Family Narcissism Hits Different

Narcissism in romantic relationships or friendships is painful, but you came to those relationships as a formed person. You had a self before they arrived, even if they tried to dismantle it.

Family narcissism operates at a deeper level:

1. **You had no choice.** You couldn't leave. You were dependent on them for survival.
2. **You had no comparison.** Your family's patterns were your only model for how relationships work.
3. **It shaped your development.** Your brain literally formed in response to their behavior.
4. **The bond is primal.** Parent-child attachment isn't just emotional—it's biological.

This is why family work often feels more destabilizing than work on other relationships. You're not just healing from harm; you're questioning the foundation of your understanding of love, family, and self.

**What this feels like in your body:**

When you start to see your family clearly, you may feel:
- Groundlessness—like the floor is disappearing
- Grief that seems endless
- Guilt that makes you want to stop looking
- Relief mixed with rage
- Disorientation about who you are if not who they said you were

> **Field Note:** The first time her therapist said *"That sounds like emotional abuse,"* she laughed. Abuse? Her parents never hit her. They provided everything—the nice house, the good schools, the family vacations. But as the therapist asked more questions, she started shaking. The constant criticism wasn't high standards—it was control. The silent treatments weren't discipline—they were punishment. The way she always felt wrong, never good enough, walking on eggshells in her own home—that wasn't normal. She drove home that day and sat in her car for an hour, unable to move. Everything she thought she knew about her childhood was rearranging itself. She wasn't ungrateful. She wasn't too sensitive. She was a child who learned that love came with conditions she could never fully meet.

All of this is normal. You're not falling apart—you're rearranging. The foundation was always unstable; now you're feeling it.

## Assigned Roles in the Narcissistic Family

Narcissistic family systems assign roles. These roles serve the narcissist's needs and maintain the family's dysfunctional balance. They're not chosen; they're imposed—often in childhood before you could understand what was happening.

The roles are not about who you are. They're about what the system needed you to be.

### The Golden Child

**What it looks like:** The favored one. The one who can do no wrong. The extension of the narcissist's glory. Praised, protected, centered.

**The hidden cost:** Being loved conditionally, for performance and compliance rather than for self. Carrying the weight of the narcissist's projected perfection. Never being seen as a real person with flaws. Fear of falling from grace.

**What it feels like to be the Golden Child:**

On the surface, you have everything. Approval. Attention. The parent's warmth—when you perform. But underneath, you feel the precariousness. You know the love can be withdrawn. You've seen what happens to the Scapegoat when they displease.

So you perform. Perfectly. Exhaustingly. You become who they need you to be. And somewhere in there, you lose track of who you actually are.

The worst part: you might not even realize you're suffering. Everyone tells you how lucky you are. The Scapegoat resents you. You're supposed to be grateful. But the cage is still a cage, even when it's gold.

> **Field Note:** She was the good one. Straight A's, captain of the team, full scholarship. Her mother introduced her to everyone as *"my perfect daughter."* She didn't realize until her thirties that she had no idea what she actually wanted—she only knew what made her mother proud. When she got engaged to someone her mother didn't approve of, the warmth vanished overnight. Suddenly she was *"throwing away everything we built."* Twenty-eight years of being golden, and one choice her mother didn't like erased it all. That's when she understood: she wasn't loved for who she was. She was loved for being her mother's trophy. And trophies don't get to have their own lives.

In collectivist families, the Golden Child often carries the family's collective aspirations — the one who gets the education, who's supposed to "make it," who bears the weight of the immigrant dream or the family's social standing in the community. In Jewish families, this child carries *nachas* — the pride and joy parents derive from their children's achievements. "My son the doctor." "My daughter the lawyer." In Hispanic families, it's the one who's supposed to rise above. In both, the Golden Child isn't loved for who they are — they're loved for what they represent. The conditional love is tied to a collective investment. Disappointing the narcissistic parent doesn't just wound one person — it wounds everyone who pinned their hopes on you.

**Adult patterns:** May struggle with perfectionism, fear of failure, difficulty with authentic relationships (accustomed to performing rather than being), or may become narcissistic themselves. Often has imposter syndrome—the praise never felt deserved because it was for the performance, not the person.

**The liberation:** You are allowed to be imperfect. You are allowed to disappoint them. Your worth was never contingent on being their trophy. The fall from the pedestal is terrifying—and also freedom.

### The Scapegoat

**What it looks like:** The "problem child." Blamed for family dysfunction. Criticized, punished, othered. Everything that goes wrong is somehow their fault.

**The hidden gift:** Scapegoats often see the truth that others deny. Their "problematic" behavior may be healthy rebellion against a sick system. They're often the first to break free.

**What it feels like to be the Scapegoat:**

You carry the family's shadow. Their dysfunction, their shame, their failures—all projected onto you. You're the reason things are hard. You're too sensitive, too angry, too difficult, too much.

You may have internalized it. Believed you really were the problem. Spent years trying to be "better," to finally earn the love that flowed so easily to the Golden Child. Or you stopped trying and became what they said you were—because at least that was something.

The crazy-making part: when you point out what's wrong, you become proof of what's wrong. Your accurate perception becomes your pathology.

> **Field Note:** She was twelve when she asked why her father got to scream at them but they couldn't raise their voices at him. The room went silent. Then: *"This is exactly what I'm talking about. You're always trying to cause problems."* Her mother later told her she'd ruined Thanksgiving. She was the one who named things. The rages. The double standards. The hypocrisy. And every time she named them, she became the problem—not the things she was naming. By high school she'd stopped talking at family dinners. By college she'd stopped coming home. They told everyone she was "difficult" and "always had issues." No one knew she was the only one telling the truth.

**Adult patterns:** May struggle with shame, self-blame, expecting rejection, difficulty trusting. But also may have hard-won clarity and resilience. Often becomes a truth-teller. May have trouble believing good things can last.

**The liberation:** You were never the problem. You were the one who felt the problem and couldn't pretend it didn't exist. Your sensitivity was accurate. Your rebellion was sane.

### The Lost Child

**What it looks like:** Invisible. The quiet one who doesn't make waves. Withdraws to avoid conflict. Neither praised nor blamed—just overlooked.

**The hidden cost:** Learning that you don't matter. That your needs aren't important. That the safest position is to disappear.

**What it feels like to be the lost child:**

Silence is your survival strategy. You learned early that taking up space draws fire. That having needs creates problems. That the safest way to exist is to barely exist.

You became easy. Low-maintenance. Self-sufficient before you were developmentally ready. You handled your own feelings because no one was coming. You made yourself small so you wouldn't be a target.

And it worked—you weren't attacked. But you also weren't seen. The neglect was gentler than abuse, but it was still abandonment. You raised yourself while living in a house full of people.

> **Field Note:** She learned to make her own dinner by age seven. Not because anyone taught her—because no one noticed if she ate. Her older sibling got the attention for sports. Her younger sibling got it for tantrums. She got nothing because she needed nothing. Or that's what they thought. She taught herself not to need. She'd sit in her room reading for hours and no one checked on her. When she finally moved out at eighteen, her father said *"I didn't even realize you were gone."* He laughed like it was a joke. It wasn't. She'd practiced being invisible for so long she'd actually disappeared.

> **Field Note:** She did her own laundry starting in elementary school. Years later, her parents remarked that she was *"always so good—we never had to worry about you."* Both things were true and neither canceled the other out. She was overlooked—no one checked if she needed help, no one noticed what she was handling alone. And she was praised—for being easy, for not making demands, for raising herself without complaint. The praise didn't undo the neglect. It just made it harder to name. How do you grieve being ignored when everyone keeps telling you how good you were?

**Adult patterns:** Difficulty asserting needs, feeling invisible in groups and relationships, isolation, depression. May recreate the invisibility in adult life. Relationships where you're taken for granted. Struggle to believe you matter.

**The liberation:** You exist. You matter. Your needs are valid. The invisibility was a survival strategy, not your identity. You're allowed to take up space now.

*If you're the Lost Child, you may notice this section felt brief—perhaps even too brief. That invisibility you're sensing right now? That's the very pattern this role creates. You've just experienced what you've lived: being overlooked, given less space, noticed less. Your noticing is valid. You deserved more.*

### The Mascot

**What it looks like:** The entertainer. Uses humor, charm, or performance to deflect family tension. The comic relief. Smooths things over with lightness.

**The hidden cost:** Feelings are never taken seriously—including your own. You learn to perform rather than feel. Your pain gets buried under jokes.

**What it feels like to be the mascot:**

You learned that your value is in making things lighter. When tension rises, you diffuse it. When someone is hurting, you make them laugh. When you're hurting, you make yourself laugh.

It's exhausting. And lonely. Because no one knows what's underneath the performance. You're not sure you know anymore either. The smile has been on so long it might be stuck.

And when you try to be serious, to share something real, it feels wrong. They expect the performer. They need the performer. So you keep performing.

> **Field Note:** My job was to cut the tension. When my parents fought—which was constantly—I'd do something ridiculous. A pratfall. A weird voice. Anything to make them laugh and forget they were destroying each other. It worked. I became the class clown, then the funny friend, then the partner who never brought up serious things. When my grandmother died, I made jokes at the funeral because I didn't know how else to feel. My girlfriend finally asked: *"Do you ever just let yourself be sad?"* I didn't know how. Sadness was dangerous in my house. Sadness escalated things. I'd learned to swallow every heavy feeling and produce lightness on demand. I was thirty-five before I cried in front of another person.

**Adult patterns:** Difficulty accessing genuine emotion, using humor to avoid depth, feeling that you must always be "on," relationships that stay surface-level. May struggle with depression that no one sees coming because you always seem "fine."

**The liberation:** You're allowed to not be funny. You're allowed to be heavy. Your pain deserves as much attention as your humor. The performance can stop.

## Roles Can Shift

Important: these roles aren't fixed identities. They're positions in a system.

The same person might be:
- Golden Child with one parent, Scapegoat with the other
- Golden Child as a kid, Scapegoat after setting boundaries as an adult
- Different roles at different ages based on the narcissist's needs

Roles can also shift when family composition changes—when one child leaves, another may be reassigned their role. When the Scapegoat goes no-contact, watch the Golden Child suddenly start being criticized.

**The moment the role shifts:**

It's disorienting when you've been golden and suddenly you're scapegoated. The parent you thought loved you turns cold. You realize the love was never for you—it was for your compliance.

> **Field Note:** For twenty-six years, she was the golden child. Her brother was the screwup, the one who couldn't hold a job, the cautionary tale. Then she came out. The same week, her brother got promoted. Suddenly he was *"finally getting his life together"* and she was *"throwing hers away."* Her mother's warmth—the thing she'd spent her whole life earning—vanished. Her brother started getting invited to dinners she didn't know about. The role she thought was hers had never been hers. It was just a position in her mother's system. When she stopped filling it the way her mother needed, someone else was found.

This is painful but clarifying. Now you know what you're dealing with.

The key insight is that **the role serves the system, not you.** It was never about who you actually are.

## Triangulation: The Narcissist's Divide-and-Conquer

Triangulation is a key tactic in narcissistic families. It involves bringing a third person into a two-person dynamic, creating conflict to maintain control.

### How It Works

**The narcissist doesn't communicate directly.** Instead:
- They tell you what your sibling "said" about you
- They complain to you about your other parent
- They compare you to another family member
- They share your confidences with others in the family
- They use children as messengers between adults

**What it feels like:**

You're never sure what's real. Someone is always upset with you, and you're not sure why. Relationships with siblings feel competitive rather than connected. You find yourself defending yourself against things you're not sure you did.

And somehow, all roads lead back to the narcissist. They're the hub of all information. The center of all conflicts. The one who "just wants everyone to get along" while ensuring everyone is fighting.

> **Field Note:** One client described not speaking to her sister for three years. Their mother had told each of them devastating things the other had supposedly said—*"a terrible mother who shouldn't have had kids"* on one side, *"a failure who would never amount to anything"* on the other. They believed it. They'd both seen each other's worst moments—it seemed plausible. When they finally spoke at a family funeral, they compared notes. Neither had said those things. Their mother had invented both conversations. She'd kept them fighting over phantom insults while she played the heartbroken peacemaker who *"just wanted her daughters to get along."* They'd lost three years to words that were never spoken.

### Why It Works

Triangulation serves the narcissist because:
- **It prevents alliances.** If siblings are fighting each other, they're not uniting against the narcissist.
- **It maintains centrality.** All information flows through them. They're the hub.
- **It creates confusion.** You're never sure who to trust or what's true.
- **It generates supply.** Family drama is a reliable source of attention and involvement.

### When the Whole Community Is the Triangle

In individualist families, triangulation involves three people. In collectivist families — extended Hispanic families, Jewish communities, tight-knit religious congregations, immigrant networks, any system where "family" means 30 people at the table — triangulation involves everyone.

The narcissistic parent doesn't need to make all the calls themselves. The system self-corrects:

- Tía calls because "tu mamá está llorando" (your mother is crying)
- Your mother's best friend from shul calls to say "your mother is beside herself"
- The pastor or rabbi reaches out to "check on the family"
- Your cousin posts a pointed quote about loyalty on social media
- Abuela — or Bubbe — leaves a voicemail. Just crying, no words.
- Your brother texts: "Why do you always have to cause problems?"

In individualist systems, these are called "flying monkeys" — people recruited to pressure you. In collectivist systems, there's no recruitment necessary. The community self-organizes around the disruption. Your boundary *is* the disruption. The calls aren't coordinated. They don't need to be. Everyone knows their role.

> **Field Note: "The Sunday Dinner"**
>
> Every Sunday, the whole family gathered. Thirty people, three generations, one dining room that shouldn't have held us all but somehow did. Abuelita at the head. Mami running the kitchen. And me, trying to be invisible while Papi held court.
>
> When I stopped coming, the calls started within hours. Not from Papi. From everyone else. Tía Rosa: "Tu papá está triste." Prima Marlena texted: "???" My brother called to say I was being dramatic. Abuelita left a voicemail — just crying, no words.
>
> I hadn't told anyone why I stopped coming. I didn't need to. In my family, absence *is* the offense. The reason doesn't matter. You were supposed to be there. You weren't. That's the crime.
>
> I went back the next Sunday. Papi smiled like nothing happened. "Ahí está mi hija." Everyone relaxed. The system had corrected itself.
>
> I realized: I wasn't fighting my father. I was fighting the whole table.

> **Field Note: "The Open Secret"**
>
> I came out to my mother when I was sixteen. She cried for three days. Then she told me she loved me but that we would never discuss it again. "No se lo digas a tu padre."
>
> I became the family's open secret. Everyone knew. No one spoke about it. I held this invisible weight — the thing that was true about me but couldn't exist in the family's reality.
>
> When I brought my partner home for Christmas, my mother pulled me aside. "¿Por qué me haces esto?" My partner — the person I loved — was framed as something I was *doing to her*. My identity was an act of aggression against my own mother.
>
> The narcissistic dynamic wasn't the homophobia. It was the way my truth became about her suffering. My coming out wasn't my liberation — it was her wound. And I was expected to manage her pain about *my* life.

> **PRACTICAL TOOL: The Direct Communication Practice**
>
> When you suspect triangulation, try this:
>
> 1. **Go direct:** Instead of responding to what you "heard" someone said, reach out to them directly. "Hey, Mom mentioned you were upset with me. What's going on?"
>
> 2. **Verify before reacting:** Before defending yourself against reported accusations, check the source. "Did you actually say X?"
>
> 3. **Name the pattern:** If it's safe, call out the triangulation gently. "I'd prefer we talk directly rather than through Mom."
>
> 4. **Refuse the messenger role:** When asked to pass along messages, decline. "I think that's a conversation for the two of you."
>
> *Breaking triangulation doesn't require confrontation. It requires building direct lines of communication that bypass the hub.*

### The Trap

In a triangulated family, you may find yourself:
- Constantly managing relationships with third parties based on reported information
- Unable to have direct, honest relationships with siblings or other family members
- Uncertain what's real because everything has been filtered through the narcissist
- Defending yourself against accusations that came through intermediaries

### When Children Become Weapons

One of the most insidious forms of triangulation uses children—not as messengers, but as *evidence*. A child's words become ammunition. "Children don't lie" becomes a trump card that ends all discussion.

But children do repeat things out of context. They do absorb adult tensions and reflect them back in fragments. They do say what they sense will please the adult asking the questions. Using a child's statement as irrefutable proof isn't honoring the child's truth—it's weaponizing their innocence.

> **Field Note:** In one family I worked with, the older sister pulled the younger onto a phone call to witness her confronting their mother. She told their mother that her daughter had said Grandma loved her the most—more than her own parents. *"Children don't lie,"* the older sister said, like she was presenting evidence in court. The mother tried to explain, tried to say that wasn't what she meant, that kids say things, that of course she loved everyone. But there was no defense against a child's words treated as testimony. The younger sister sat there on the call, pulled in as a witness to this ambush, watching her mother scramble to defend herself against a grandchild's innocent comment turned into proof of favoritism. The mother later said she felt gaslit—accused of something she couldn't disprove because the "evidence" was a child's offhand remark. The older sister got to play prosecutor, the child was the unwitting witness, and the younger sister was the audience meant to validate the verdict. No one won. Especially not the kid whose words got turned into a weapon she never meant to wield.

**What to watch for:**
- A child's statement presented as "proof" of your wrongdoing
- "Out of the mouths of babes" used to shut down your perspective
- Being put on speakerphone or pulled into calls as a witness to confrontations
- Children being questioned in ways that produce useful answers

**The damage:** The adult being accused feels trapped—you can't argue with a child's words without seeming defensive. The child learns their words have explosive power they don't understand. And the person wielding this tactic gets to hide behind a child's innocence while launching an adult attack.

### Projection Through the Triangle

Sometimes the third person isn't a messenger or a weapon—they're an *audience* for projection. The narcissistic family member says something about you *to* someone else that's really about themselves. It's indirect communication wrapped in projection, and it reveals more about the speaker than the target.

> **Field Note:** In the same family, the older sister made a mistake and somehow flipped the whole thing to make it her younger sister's fault. Then, while explaining the situation to her daughter—right in front of her sister—she said *"she is so old"* about her. As if her supposed age explained her supposed error. The thing is, the younger sister was younger by years. The projection was so transparent that even the daughter caught it. The kid looked confused and said, *"Mommy, she's not that old."* The younger sister felt humiliated—blamed for something she didn't do, criticized in front of a child, reduced to a punchline about aging. But in that moment, watching a child see through what her sister couldn't admit to herself, something clicked. She wasn't really talking about her sister. She was externalizing her own anxiety about getting older, her own fear of making mistakes, and her sister was just the screen she projected it onto. The blame-shifting and the age comment served the same purpose: keep her discomfort outside herself, on someone else.
>
> What stayed with the younger sister wasn't her own humiliation—it was watching that child in that system. The kid spoke up this time. She saw what was off and said so. But in families like these, that clarity gets trained out of you. Children learn somewhere along the way that speaking up isn't safe, that expressing feelings isn't welcome. That girl still had her clarity. The question is whether the system would let her keep it.

**What's happening:** The speaker avoids confronting their own discomfort by attributing it to you. By saying it to a third party rather than directly, they get to express the feeling while maintaining deniability. It wasn't about them—it was an observation about you.

**The tell:** When the thing they're saying doesn't match reality—especially when even a child can see it doesn't fit—you're watching projection in real time. Their words reveal their wounds, not yours.

### Breaking Triangulation

- **Go direct.** If you hear that someone has a problem with you, talk to them directly—not through the intermediary.
- **Refuse the relay.** "I appreciate you sharing, but I'd prefer if [person] told me directly."
- **Hold boundaries on gossip.** Don't participate in discussions about family members who aren't present.
- **Verify before reacting.** What you heard secondhand may be distorted.

### Tactical Scripts for Triangulation

**When they report what someone "said" about you:**
- "That's interesting. I'll talk to them directly."
- "I prefer to hear it from them."
- "Thanks for letting me know. I'll handle it myself."

**When they try to make you the messenger:**
- "That sounds like something to tell them directly."
- "I'm not the right person to pass that along."
- "I'd rather not be in the middle."

**When they gossip about a family member:**
- "I'd rather not discuss [name] when they're not here."
- "I'll let you two work that out."
- *Change the subject*

**The strategic value:** Every time you refuse the triangle, you weaken their information hub and protect sibling relationships they've been poisoning.

*The roles were assigned. The triangles were constructed. None of it was about who you actually are.*
