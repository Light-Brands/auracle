# Pre-Publication Legal Review — Vol 1: SEE

**Manuscript:** *See: The Truth That Was Hidden in Plain Sight* (Volume One, The Sovereignty Series)
**Author:** Jennifer Brooke Lawless
**Review Date:** February 18, 2026
**Scope:** Full manuscript — Front Matter through Chapter 17

---

## Executive Summary

This manuscript is a memoir/self-help hybrid about narcissistic abuse by a named, identifiable author. "My sister," "my mother," "my ex-husband" are therefore traceable to real, living people by anyone in the author's social circle.

**Overall Manuscript Risk: MEDIUM-HIGH**

The author has done significant protective work — the disclaimers are strong, the writing is predominantly archetypal and pattern-based, and there is explicit language throughout disclaiming diagnosis. However, specific passages where the writing drops from archetype into identifiable personal anecdote create defamation, private-facts, and false-light risk. The exes being wealthy and legally connected makes these vulnerabilities actionable.

**The good news:** Most findings are fixable with targeted edits that preserve the book's power while reducing legal exposure. Chapters 12-15 and 17 are legally clean. The vulnerability is concentrated in Field Notes across Chapters 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, and 16.

---

## Existing Disclaimers Assessment

The front matter contains several protective elements:

1. **Author's Note** — Names/details changed, composites used, events compressed, dialogue recreated, subjective perspective
2. **Field Experience Note** — Changed details, composites, "this book describes patterns, not people"
3. **Diagnosis Note** — "Narcissist" refers to behavioral patterns, not clinical diagnosis
4. **Professional Disclaimer** — Standard "not rendering professional services" language

**Assessment:** Well-drafted and meaningful. However, disclaimers do not immunize against all claims. Where content is specific enough to be identifiable despite changed names, courts have held that disclaimers are insufficient.

## CRITICAL Findings (Must Change Before Publication)

### CRITICAL-1: Exit Phase Escalation Case Study
**Chapter 11, lines 495-534**

The single most dangerous passage for ex-partner litigation. Stacks highly specific details: suicide threats from a balcony ("I'll jump off this balcony right now"), hand placed around partner's throat ("It's so delicate. I could snap it with one hand"), popsicle compliance test, scene in front of a visiting friend, salon hair-color critiquing, demanding "neutral" hair and nails with "no red hair, no sparkles." The passage switches from gender-neutral to gendered pronouns mid-passage, signaling a real account.

**Who could sue:** Ex-husband. Claims: defamation per se (accusation of criminal conduct — assault/threats), invasion of privacy, false light.

**Recommendation:** Remove or thoroughly composite. Remove all uniquely identifying details (balcony, popsicle, throat, sparkles, visiting friend). Fix the pronoun slip. Consider explicit composite framing.

---

### CRITICAL-2: "The Testimony" — Custody/Court Scene
**Chapter 8, lines 132-161**

Describes a child coached by her mother to testify against her father. Explicitly calls the testimony a "lie." Accuses the mother of witness coaching, inducing perjury, and parental alienation. These are accusations of criminal conduct (subornation of perjury, witness tampering).

**Who could sue:** Author's mother — defamation per se (accusation of criminal conduct). Court proceedings involving children are often sealed; publishing details may violate court orders.

**Recommendation:** Remove entirely or rewrite as general educational content about loyalty binds in custody situations. No disclaimer can protect an accusation of criminal conduct against an identifiable person. Consult litigation attorney about sealed-record issues.

---

### CRITICAL-3: Sister Weaponizing Her Child
**Chapter 7, line 237**

"My sister once pulled me onto a phone call to witness her confronting our mom. She told our mother that her granddaughter had said Grandma loved her the most." Accuses the sister of weaponizing her child, staging an "ambush," gaslighting the mother. Involves a minor child (the niece) whose words are published. Characterizes the sister as "prosecutor."

**Who could sue:** Author's sister — defamation (weaponizing child, staging ambushes, gaslighting mother), false light, invasion of privacy. Potentially on behalf of the niece — minor child's words and family dynamics disclosed publicly.

**Recommendation:** Remove the niece entirely. If anecdote must stay, present as third-person composite: "In one family I worked with..." Remove characterizations of intent ("prosecutor," "ambush," "weapon she never meant to wield").

---

### CRITICAL-4: Ex-Partner Alcoholism Field Note
**Chapter 5, lines 715-719**

First-person account attributing to "he": functional alcoholism, personality shifts after "the third drink," cruelty and contempt when drunk ("cold, contemptuous, sometimes frightening"), gaslighting about drinking, blame-shifting. Author states she used the word "alcoholic."

**Who could sue:** Ex-partner. Claims: defamation per se (accusation of alcoholism — imputation of condition rendering one unfit for social interaction + cruelty), public disclosure of private facts (drinking behavior, intimate dynamics).

**Recommendation:** Convert to third-person composite with significantly altered details. Remove first-person framing. If any version remains, ensure no specific details ("third drink," "flowers or sex or elaborate breakfast") map onto a recognizable person.

---

## HIGH Risk Findings (Strongly Recommend Changing)

### HIGH-1: Sister Phone Call Collapse
**Chapter 2, line 232**

"A fifteen-minute phone call with my sister would knock me out for three hours... My husband started noticing: 'You talked to your sister again, didn't you?'" Places the sister in the context of a chapter about controlling/narcissistic people. Implies the sister is so toxic that contact causes physical collapse.

**Recommendation:** Change "my sister" to "a family member" or convert to third-person composite.

---

### HIGH-2: Sister Projection / Niece Welfare
**Chapter 7, lines 251-253**

"My sister made a mistake and somehow flipped the whole thing to make it my fault." Psychoanalyzes the sister in print. Implies the niece is being raised in a harmful environment. "I don't want her to become like me."

**Recommendation:** Remove references to the niece. Remove psychological analysis of the sister's motivations. Generalize: "A family member made a comment about my age in front of others."

---

### HIGH-3: Sister Triangulation — "Sarah"
**Chapter 7, line 195**

"I didn't speak to my sister for three years. My mother told me Sarah had said I was 'a terrible mother'... Our mother had invented both conversations." Accuses the mother of fabricating conversations. Uses pseudonym "Sarah" but sister is identifiable by relation.

**Recommendation:** Convert to clinical composite framing ("One client described..."). Remove "Sarah." Soften "invented" to "When we compared notes, neither of us recalled saying those things."

---

### HIGH-4: Ex Head-Patting — Grandiose Narcissist
**Chapter 5, lines 455-458**

"My ex had this habit... He'd pat my head." Placed directly under "The Grandiose Narcissist" heading. Specific recognizable physical behavior attributed to an identifiable person, explicitly categorized as a grandiose narcissist.

**Recommendation:** Convert to third-person composite. Remove "my ex."

---

### HIGH-5: Reproductive Coercion Section
**Chapter 11, lines 227-232**

Describes "the pregnancy trap" and "birth control sabotage." If any reader connects this to the author's relationships, it implies a specific identifiable man was "trapped" or that the author engaged in reproductive coercion.

**Recommendation:** Add explicit attribution to clinical/research literature. Ensure section cannot be read as autobiographical.

---

### HIGH-6: Friend Labeled Covert Narcissist
**Chapter 5, lines 496-498**

"I had a friend who called whenever she was in crisis..." Placed under "The Covert (Vulnerable) Narcissist" heading. Anyone in the author's social circle who knows of a friendship matching this description would identify the person.

**Recommendation:** Convert to third-person composite.

---

### HIGH-7: Aesthetic Seesaw Specifics
**Chapter 3, lines 553-568**

"You need to have neutral hair when we see my friends." "No sparkles on your nails." These read as direct quotations. Combined with salon reference, they're a fingerprint.

**Recommendation:** Generalize. Replace with clearly generic language: "Dictating how you should look when meeting their social circle."

| Ch. 13: Exposure Questions | PROTECTED | Entirely educational/prescriptive. Zero personal narratives. |
| Ch. 14: Decoder Protocol | PROTECTED | Purely instructional tools and frameworks. |
| Ch. 15: Energetic Remapping | PROTECTED | Recovery/therapeutic content only. |
| Ch. 17: Moving Forward | PROTECTED | Aspirational/therapeutic. No identifiable individuals. |

## Cross-Cutting Systemic Issues

### 1. Cumulative "Mosaic" Identification

The accumulation of anecdotes about "my ex," "my mother," "my sister," "my aunt" across the book creates jigsaw identification. A plaintiff's attorney would assemble all passages describing similar dynamics and argue they collectively identify a single person with granular specificity. Each individual passage has its own risk level, but the cumulative effect is greater than the sum of its parts.

**Recommendation:** Track which passages appear to describe the same real individual. For each identifiable person, ensure no more than one or two passages contain specific enough details to function as identifying information.

### 2. "Nonfiction" Label

The Author's Note says "This is a work of nonfiction." By declaring the work nonfiction, every accusation is presented as factually true. If framed as "memoir" or "creative nonfiction," courts give more latitude to subjective recollection.

**Recommendation:** Change "This is a work of nonfiction" to "This is a memoir" or "This is a work of creative nonfiction."

### 3. Minor Child Policy

The niece appears in passages where she can be identified through the author's known family relationships. Children cannot consent to inclusion in published narratives about family dysfunction.

**Recommendation:** Adopt a firm policy that no identifiable minor child appears in any passage.

### 4. Field Note Disclaimer

Add at the beginning of the first Field Note or in front matter: "All field notes are composites drawn from multiple sources. No single note depicts a specific individual."

---

## Priority Action Items

### Tier 1: Must Change (4 CRITICAL findings)
1. Ch. 11 Exit Phase case study — composite or strip identifying details
2. Ch. 8 "The Testimony" — remove or rewrite as educational content
3. Ch. 7 Sister weaponizing child — remove niece, composite the anecdote
4. Ch. 5 Alcoholism field note — convert to third-person composite

### Tier 2: Strongly Recommend (7 HIGH findings)
5. Ch. 2 Sister phone call — change "my sister" to "a family member"
6. Ch. 7 Sister projection + niece — remove niece references
7. Ch. 7 Sister triangulation "Sarah" — convert to composite
8. Ch. 5 Head-patting field note — remove "my ex"
9. Ch. 11 Reproductive coercion — add clinical attribution
10. Ch. 5 Friend as covert narcissist — convert to composite
11. Ch. 3 Aesthetic seesaw quotes — generalize

### Tier 3: Structural Changes
12. Change "nonfiction" to "memoir" in Author's Note
13. Add field note composite disclaimer
14. Remove all identifiable references to the niece
15. Implement systematic compositing of first-person Field Notes

### Tier 4: Consider Changing (27 MEDIUM findings)
See MEDIUM findings table above. These are defensible with current disclaimers but represent cumulative exposure.

## Plaintiff Risk Assessment

| **Sister** | 6 findings (Ch. 2, 7, 10, 16) | CRITICAL | Possible | Unknown |
| **Mother** | 8 findings (Ch. 2, 7, 8, 16) | CRITICAL | Unlikely | Unlikely |
| **Aunt** | 1 finding (Ch. 5) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Unlikely | Unknown |
| **Friend** | 1 finding (Ch. 5) | HIGH | Unlikely | Unknown |
| **Niece (minor)** | 2 findings (Ch. 7) | CRITICAL | Via sister | N/A |
| **Ex-boyfriend (bodybuilder)** | 1 finding (Ch. 5) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Unknown | Unknown |

## Closing Assessment

The core text (non-Field-Note material) is legally sound across all chapters. The vulnerability is concentrated in **Field Notes** — first-person anecdotes where the writing drops from archetype into identifiable personal narrative.

The solution is not to remove these notes (they are the book's emotional power), but to systematically convert them from first-person identifiable accounts ("my sister," "my ex," "my aunt") into third-person composites with sufficiently altered details.

The two structural changes that would most reduce risk across the entire manuscript:
1. Changing "nonfiction" to "memoir"
2. Adding a universal field-note composite disclaimer

With targeted edits to the CRITICAL and HIGH findings plus these structural changes, the manuscript's legal risk profile drops from **MEDIUM-HIGH to LOW-MEDIUM** — within acceptable publishing industry standards for memoir/self-help.

*This review covers legal risk identification only. It does not constitute legal advice and should be supplemented by consultation with a licensed attorney in the author's jurisdiction of publication. Given the specific concern about wealthy, legally connected ex-partners, engaging a media law attorney for full manuscript vetting before publication is strongly recommended.*
