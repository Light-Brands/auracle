Jennifer Brooke Lawless holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Boston University and a Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling from Nova Southeastern University. Her clinical work ranged from locked psychiatric units to family therapy, individual sessions, and couples counseling.

Her journey to sovereignty began in the wreckage of narcissistic relationships. In *See* (Volume 1), she named the patterns. In *Heal* (Volume 2), she crossed from insight to embodiment. This book is what she found on the other side.

Today, Jennifer lives in Costa Rica surrounded by community—on a hill with lemon trees and howler monkeys—practicing what she teaches: sovereignty without force, leadership without performing, and care without carrying.

She no longer seeks permission to take up space. She no longer confuses intensity with connection. She chooses without urgency, desires without fear, and separates without guilt.

This book is for everyone who has done the healing work and is now asking: *Who am I when I stop shrinking?*

The answer is here. And so are you.
