## Design Notes

### Title Pattern

- Volumes 1–7 use: **"You Are Not [fear]"**
- Volume 8 shifts to: **"You Were Never Broken"**
- This tense shift is the emotional payoff of the entire series — the reader realizes the framework of brokenness was always an illusion

### Subtitle Pattern

- Each subtitle opens with its arc word as an imperative verb
- Read together, they form a progressive command sequence
- The subtitles are the action; the titles are the validation

### Typography Hierarchy

1. **TITLE** — Largest, most prominent. ALL CAPS recommended for maximum impact.
2. **Subtitle** — Medium size, italic or lighter weight. Mixed case.
3. **Series/Volume line** — Small, consistent across all 8 covers.
4. **Author name** — Smallest but clearly legible. Consider ALL CAPS.

### Spine Text (Paperback)

```
[ARC WORD]  |  YOU ARE NOT ___  |  Jennifer Brooke Lawless
```

When all 8 spines are lined up, the arc words read:

```
SEE | HEAL | STAND | LIVE | GIVE | SERVE | THRIVE | BECOME
```

### Color Progression Suggestion

The series should move from darker tones (recognition, crisis) to lighter/warmer tones (healing, embodiment) to radiant tones (sovereignty, transcendence):

| Vol | Arc | Suggested Palette Direction |
|:---:|:---:|---------------------------|
| 1 | SEE | Dark — charcoal, deep gold |
| 2 | HEAL | Grounding — teal, warm copper |
| 3 | STAND | Authoritative — navy, silver |
| 4 | LIVE | Radiant — plum, rose gold |
| 5 | GIVE | Warm — earth tones, amber |
| 6 | SERVE | Clean — sage, warm white |
| 7 | THRIVE | Abundant — rich green, gold |
| 8 | BECOME | Transcendent — white, iridescent, light gold |

### Series Cohesion Requirements

- Same font family across all 8 covers
- Consistent gold accent color on all volumes
- Identical layout structure (title position, author placement)
- "You Are Not Smallty Series" subtitle on each
- Volume number + arc word in consistent position
