# Platform Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up the three platforms for your book release. Total time: 2-3 hours.

---

## 0. Format & Series Strategy (Do This First)

### Dual Format: Publish Both at Once

Publish **Kindle eBook + Paperback** simultaneously for every volume:

| Format | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Kindle eBook** | Main discovery engine + reviews + Kindle Unlimited reads |
| **Paperback** | Credibility + gifting + upsells + higher perceived value |
| **Hardcover** | Can wait — add later if the series proves traction |

### ISBN Strategy

| Format | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Kindle eBook** | No ISBN needed (Amazon assigns ASIN automatically) |
| **Paperback (Vol 1)** | Use Amazon's free ISBN — fast, free, zero downside at this stage |
| **Paperback (Vol 2+)** | Buy your own ISBNs ($295 for 10 from Bowker) if you want imprint control, otherwise continue with Amazon's free option |

Most nonfiction series never need purchased ISBNs. Re-issue earlier books later if imprint control matters.

### Series Structure in KDP (Critical for Read-Through)

When setting up each book in KDP, configure:

- **Series Name:** `The Sovereignty Series`
- **Series Number:** `1` (then `2`, `3`, etc.)
- **Consistent subtitle format across all volumes:**

| Volume | Title | Subtitle |
|--------|-------|----------|
| 1 | See | See |
| 2 | Heal | Healing Through Secure Attachment |
| 3 | Stand | Internal Authority and Self-Trust |
| 4 | Live | Living from Full Presence |

This consistency boosts read-through rate and series trust on Amazon.

### Series Spine (How Amazon Rewards Structured Nonfiction)

| Volume | Role in Series | Core Question |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| 1 — See | **Recognition / Foundations** | *What is happening to me?* |
| 2 — Heal | **Framework / Healing** | *Why did this shape me?* |
| 3 — Stand | **Application / Standing** | *Who am I when I stop shrinking?* |
| 4 — Live | **Embodiment / Living** | *How do I live from presence?* |

Amazon's algorithm rewards structured nonfiction series — each volume clearly builds on the last.

### Pricing Strategy (Updated for Series Hook)

**Price Vol 1 slightly lower to hook readers into the series:**

| Product | Amazon (eBook) | Gumroad | Notes |
|---------|---------------|---------|-------|
| Vol 1 | **$2.99–$4.99** | $9.99 (with Decoder Cards) | Lower price = 70% royalty + series hook |
| Vol 2 | $6.99–$8.99 | $12.99 | Standard pricing |
| Vol 3 | $7.99–$9.99 | $14.99 | Value increases with depth |
| Vol 4 | $8.99–$10.99 | $16.99 | Premium for final volume |

| Product | Amazon (Paperback) | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Vol 1 | **$14.99** | Hook price — lower than typical |
| Vol 2 | $16.99 | Standard |
| Vol 3 | $17.99 | Standard |
| Vol 4 | $19.99 | Premium |

| Bundles (Gumroad) | Price | Savings |
|-------------------|-------|---------|
| Vol 1+2 | $18.99 | 15% |
| Vol 1+2+3 | $34.99 | 20% |
| Complete Series | $44.99 | 25% |

### Launch Order (Critical — Do This in Sequence)

1. Upload ebook + paperback files
2. **Publish paperback first**
3. **Then publish ebook** (Amazon automatically links the formats)
4. Enable Series page in KDP
5. After launch:
   - Add A+ Content (enhanced product page — free with Brand Registry or KDP)
   - Add editorial reviews
   - Update description once reader reviews start coming in
