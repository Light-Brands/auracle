## Volume Specifications

### Estimated Page Counts and Spine Widths

Page estimates based on ~275 words/page for 6x9 nonfiction with standard formatting, plus ~15 pages for front/back matter. White paper thickness: 0.002252" per page.

| Vol | Title | Word Count | Est. Pages | Spine Width | Spine Text? |
|:---:|:-----:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 | SEE | ~96,000 | ~364 | 0.820" | Yes |
| 2 | HEAL | ~104,000 | ~393 | 0.885" | Yes |
| 3 | STAND | ~79,000 | ~302 | 0.680" | Yes |
| 4 | LIVE | ~61,000 | ~237 | 0.534" | Yes |
| 5 | GIVE | ~71,000 | ~273 | 0.615" | Yes |
| 6 | SERVE | ~73,000 | ~280 | 0.631" | Yes |
| 7 | THRIVE | ~70,000 | ~270 | 0.608" | Yes |
| 8 | BECOME | ~40,000 | ~160 | 0.360" | Yes |

**Note:** These are estimates. Final spine widths must be confirmed after manuscript formatting using the [KDP Cover Calculator](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/cover-calculator). All volumes exceed the 79-page minimum for spine text. The designer should build the template system to accommodate spine width variation across volumes.

### Full Wrap PDF Dimensions (Paperback)

Formula: `0.125" bleed + 6" back + spine + 6" front + 0.125" bleed` x `0.125" + 9" + 0.125"`

### The Two Through-Lines (Designer Should Know)

**The Titles form a mantra:** SEE → HEAL → STAND → LIVE → GIVE → SERVE → THRIVE → BECOME

**The Subtitles form a poem when read together:**
> *The truth that was hidden in plain sight...*
> *The body that remembers the way home...*
> *The ground that was always yours...*
> *The presence that changes everything...*
> *The chain that ends with you...*
> *The light that doesn't consume...*
> *The life you were told you couldn't have...*
> *The self that was never lost.*

## Spine Text Layout (Paperback)

Standard spine format for each volume:

```
SEE  |  The Truth That Was Hidden in Plain Sight  |  Jennifer Brooke Lawless
```

When all 8 spines are shelved together, the titles read:

```
SEE | HEAL | STAND | LIVE | GIVE | SERVE | THRIVE | BECOME
```

**Spine text rules:**
- Text reads top-to-bottom (standard US convention)
- Minimum 0.0625" clearance from spine edges
- Title should be the most prominent element on the spine
- Author name at the bottom of the spine

---

## Back Cover Layout (Paperback)

Amazon KDP gives the designer full control over the back cover as part of the full-wrap PDF. Here is the standard nonfiction layout:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

```

**Barcode area:** Reserve a 2" x 1.2" white rectangle in the lower-right corner, at least 0.25" from the spine and 0.25" from the trim edge. Amazon auto-places the ISBN barcode if one is not supplied.

**Author photo:** AI-enhanced professional headshot generated from a real photo (see `public/photos/author-headshot.jpg`). Industry standard for nonfiction — builds trust and credibility. Use the same photo across all 8 volumes for series consistency.

**Safety margins:** Keep all text at least 0.25" from trim edges (0.5" recommended for important content).

### Back Cover Blurbs

#### Volume 1: SEE

> You left the conversation feeling worse about yourself — but you can't explain why.
>
> *See* names the 60 patterns of control disguised as care. Learn to recognize gaslighting, love-bombing, triangulation, and trauma bonds before they hook your nervous system. Includes decoder cards for real-time recognition and practical scripts for responding from power instead of reaction.
>
> The confusion ends here. Your sovereignty begins.

**Tagline:** *"Every pattern you can name is a pattern that loses power over you."*

---

#### Volume 2: HEAL

> You can name the tactics. You see the patterns. And yet your nervous system still reacts.
>
> *Heal* closes the gap between insight and embodiment. Learn why awareness alone doesn't heal, how childhood roles shape adult attraction, and how to retrain your nervous system for secure attachment. Includes a 12-week training program, reparenting practices, and guidance for dating after trauma.
>
> Stop surviving connection. Start feeling safe in it.

**Tagline:** *"Secure attachment is not found — it is practiced."*

---

#### Volume 3: STAND

> You've done the healing work. So why does calm feel uncomfortable?
>
> *Stand* teaches you to inhabit the space that healing created. Install internal authority — making decisions without outsourcing, holding space without absorbing, and leading without performing. Includes integration practices, daily anchors, and sovereignty decoder cards.
>
> This is not about becoming bigger. It's about learning to stay.

**Tagline:** *"I am not small. I am learning to stand without fear."*

---

#### Volume 4: LIVE

> Your sovereignty is installed. Now something new becomes possible: your presence can lead, not perform.
>
> *Live* explores the physiological reality of your energy field, reclaiming sexuality after trauma, and leading through coherence rather than tactics. Includes daily aura hygiene practices and the consent ladder.
>
> Your presence is already powerful. This book makes it coherent.

**Tagline:** *"My presence is erotic when it belongs to me."*

---

#### Volume 5: GIVE

> You don't have to be healed to be a good parent. You have to be healing.
>
> *Give* is about conscious parenting after trauma — breaking generational cycles not through perfection, but through awareness. Learn to repair, attune, and raise children who trust themselves.
>
> The chain breaks with you.

**Tagline:** *"The chain breaks with you. Not because you're perfect, but because you're aware."*

---

#### Volume 6: SERVE

> Your healing is your credential. Your boundaries are your offering.
>
> *Serve* explores how to help others without losing yourself — sustainable service that doesn't consume. For therapists, coaches, healers, and anyone who gives from their wound instead of their wisdom.
>
> The light that heals doesn't burn.

**Tagline:** *"Your healing is your credential. Your boundaries are your offering."*

---

#### Volume 7: THRIVE

> You were told that thriving was selfish. That ambition was betrayal. That wanting more was proof you hadn't healed enough.
>
> *Thrive* dismantles the survival mindset that kept you small. Build a life of abundance, joy, and prosperity — not as rebellion, but as the natural fruit of sovereignty.
>
> You are allowed to thrive, not just survive.

**Tagline:** *"Your prosperity is not a betrayal of your healing. It is a fruit of it."*

---

#### Volume 8: BECOME

> This is not the beginning of a new self. It is the unveiling of who you always were.
>
> *Become* is the capstone of the Sovereignty Series — integrating everything into identity. Not a final destination, but a recognition that the journey was always a homecoming.
>
> You were never becoming someone new. You were always arriving.

**Tagline:** *"You were never becoming someone new. You were always unveiling who you'd been all along."*

---

### Back Cover Author Bio (Short — for all volumes)

> **Jennifer Brooke Lawless** holds degrees in Psychology (Boston University) and Mental Health Counseling (Nova Southeastern University). Her clinical work ranged from psychiatric units to family therapy and couples counseling. After surviving narcissistic relationships and discovering that insight alone doesn't heal, she wrote the book she needed but couldn't find. She lives in Costa Rica.

## Ebook Cover (Front Only)

Amazon Kindle ebooks use a front cover only — no back cover, no spine.

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Dimensions** | 2560 x 1600 px (ideal) |
| **Aspect Ratio** | 1.6:1 |
| **Format** | JPEG or TIFF |
| **Color Mode** | RGB |
| **Resolution** | 300 DPI |
| **File Size** | Under 50 MB |

**Design notes:**
- Title must be readable at 80px height (thumbnail browsing on mobile)
- Avoid text near edges — Amazon adds a slight border
- If the background is white or very light, add a subtle 3-4px medium gray border
- The ebook cover should match the front panel of the paperback wrap exactly

---

## Design Direction

### Creative Freedom

The designer has full creative freedom on:
- **Color palette** — suggested progression below is a starting point, not a constraint
- **Font choices** — only requirement is consistency across all 8 volumes
- **Imagery, textures, and visual language** — abstract, typographic, photographic, or illustrative
- **Layout refinements** — the hierarchy must be maintained but positioning is flexible

### Suggested Color Progression (Starting Point)

The series moves from dark (crisis/recognition) through grounded tones (healing) to radiant (sovereignty/transcendence):

| Vol | Title | Palette Direction | Emotional Arc |
|:---:|:-----:|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | SEE | Dark — charcoal, deep gold | Crisis, decoding, revelation |
| 2 | HEAL | Grounding — teal, warm copper | Healing, crossing over, hope |
| 3 | STAND | Authoritative — navy, silver | Stability, groundedness, stillness |
| 4 | LIVE | Radiant — plum, rose gold | Embodiment, presence, warmth |
| 5 | GIVE | Warm — earth tones, amber | Nurturing, generational, tender |
| 6 | SERVE | Clean — sage, warm white | Sustainable, clear, purposeful |
| 7 | THRIVE | Abundant — rich green, gold | Prosperity, joy, expansion |
| 8 | BECOME | Transcendent — white, iridescent, light gold | Integration, wholeness, arrival |

### Alternative Palette Idea: Kingfisher Colors

As an additional source of inspiration, consider the colors of the kingfisher bird. The kingfisher's plumage offers a striking, nature-derived palette that could work beautifully across the series — moving from the darker, grounded tones to the more electric, transcendent ones:

| Color | Hex (Approx.) | Character |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| **Cream** | #F5F0E1 | Soft, warm, grounding — subtitles, backgrounds, breathing room |
| **Black** | #1A1A1A | Depth, authority, contrast — strong anchoring for early volumes |
| **Indigo** | #2E0854 | Mystery, sovereignty, inner knowing — rich and regal |
| **Electric light blue** | #00BFFF | Clarity, breakthrough, illumination — vivid and alive |
| **Orangey-red** | #E25822 | Fire, transformation, life force — warmth with intensity |

These five colors together carry the full arc of the series — from crisis (black) through deep inner work (indigo) to clarity (electric blue) and embodied vitality (orangey-red), with cream holding the space throughout. The designer could use them as a unified palette across all eight volumes or draw selectively from them to complement the per-volume progression suggested above.

---

### Required Series Cohesion

These elements must be consistent across all 8 covers:
- Same font family for titles
- Same font family for subtitles
- Consistent layout structure (title position, author placement, series line position)
- "The Sovereignty Series" + volume number on each
- Single-word title as the dominant visual element — this is the brand
- The 8 spines must look unified when shelved together

### Design Principles

- **Simple over busy** — the single-word titles are the brand; let them breathe
- **Readable at thumbnail** — most book browsing happens on mobile
- **Genre-appropriate** — self-help / personal transformation, not clinical psychology
- **No stock photos with people** — tends to look cheap at this genre level
- **No borders or frames** — can look dated

## What the Designer Will Receive

1. This brief (complete specifications)
2. Author headshot photo — AI-enhanced professional headshot generated from a real photo (located at `public/photos/author-headshot.jpg`)
3. Access to the [KDP Cover Calculator](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/cover-calculator) for final spine width confirmation
4. Final page counts once manuscripts are formatted (estimates provided above)

---

## Important Notes

- Spine widths are estimates based on word count. Final widths must be confirmed with the KDP Cover Calculator after manuscript formatting. The designer should build templates that accommodate easy spine width adjustment.
- The ebook cover and the front panel of the paperback wrap should be identical designs (just different file formats and color modes: RGB for ebook, CMYK for print).
- Amazon auto-places a barcode on the back cover if one is not supplied. Leave a clean 2" x 1.2" white space in the lower-right corner.
- Author photo is an AI-enhanced professional headshot generated from a real photo, located at `public/photos/author-headshot.jpg`. Use the same photo across all 8 volumes for series consistency.
- The series may eventually include hardcover editions. The same front cover design would apply; hardcover wraps have additional fold-over area that would need to be added later.
