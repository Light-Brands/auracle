### YouTube Embed Settings

- Enable `rel=0` to prevent showing unrelated videos after playback
- Set a custom thumbnail if the default doesn't look good
- Lazy-load all video embeds for page performance

---

### Screenshot Display on Website

- Display as a styled image card with subtle shadow and rounded corners
- Always include the transcribed key quote as alt text (accessibility + SEO)
- On mobile: full-width, swipeable carousel
- On desktop: masonry grid or 2-3 column layout mixed with written quotes
- Clicking a screenshot can open a lightbox for full-size viewing
- Respect privacy settings — blur or crop identifying info as noted per entry
