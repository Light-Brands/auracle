# Times Square Campaign — Designer Guide

## Billboard Composite & Promotional Media Package

**Series:** The Sovereignty Series
**Author:** Jennifer Brooke Lawless
**Campaign Concept:** Place The Sovereignty Series book covers on real Times Square billboards using photo compositing, with author street-level shots, QR code integration, and video content for website and social media

---

## 1. Campaign Overview

### The Concept

Create a set of photorealistic composites that place The Sovereignty Series book covers onto actual Times Square billboard locations. The goal is to produce marketing images and video that look indistinguishable from a real Times Square advertising campaign — the kind of viral, aspirational content that communicates "this book has arrived" and creates social proof at scale.

### Why Times Square

- **Universal recognition** — Times Square is the world's most iconic advertising venue
- **Aspirational signaling** — a billboard here says "this is a real, major work"
- **Visual drama** — the neon-lit, larger-than-life environment makes any book cover look cinematic
- **Shareability** — Times Square images are inherently social media–worthy
- **Author presence** — a photo of the author standing in front of "her own billboard" is a powerful personal branding moment

### Campaign Deliverables Summary

## 2. Source Photography — What We Need

### 2A. Times Square Billboard Base Images

Obtain high-resolution photographs of real Times Square billboard locations. These serve as the "canvas" for compositing the book covers.

**Requirements for base images:**

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Resolution | Minimum 4000 x 3000 px (ideally 6000+ px wide) |
| Format | RAW preferred, high-quality JPEG acceptable |
| Lighting | Both daytime and nighttime shots of each location |
| Angle | Straight-on (for clean compositing) + angled (for perspective shots) |
| Billboard state | Ideally showing a solid color, blank, or simple existing ad (easier to replace) |
| Surroundings | Include street-level context — pedestrians, buildings, signs — for realism |

**Priority billboard locations in Times Square:**

| Priority | Location | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **One Times Square (ball drop building)** | Most iconic and recognizable backdrop in the world |
| 2 | **NASDAQ / MarketSite tower** | Large curved LED screens, visually dramatic |
| 3 | **Times Square north (46th-47th St.)** | Multiple stacked billboards, can show multiple volumes |
| 4 | **Broadway corridor (45th St. looking north)** | Classic Times Square canyon view with billboards on both sides |
| 5 | **Duffy Square (TKTS stairs area)** | Lower angle looking up at billboards, great for author + billboard shots |

**Image sourcing options:**

1. **Original photography** — Best quality. Travel to NYC and shoot the locations with a professional camera. Shoot at golden hour (sunset) and after dark for the best billboard glow.
2. **Licensed stock photography** — Use high-resolution stock images from Shutterstock, Getty, Adobe Stock, or Unsplash. Search for "Times Square billboard blank" or "Times Square at night." Ensure the license permits commercial use and digital alteration.
3. **AI-assisted generation** — Use AI image generation to create photorealistic Times Square scenes with blank billboard spaces. Useful as a supplement but may lack the authenticity of real photography.

### 2B. Author Photography

Photographs of Jennifer in or near Times Square for compositing and standalone use.

**Shot list:**

| Shot | Description | Technical Notes |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Author looking up at billboard** | Jennifer standing at street level, looking up at where her billboard will be composited. Expression: confident, slightly awed, authentic. | Shoot from slightly below eye level. Capture natural Times Square lighting on face and body. |
| **Author holding book** | Jennifer holding Volume 1 (SEE) in front of her, cover facing camera. Times Square visible behind. | Book cover must be clearly readable. Consider a 3/4 body shot. Multiple angles. |
| **Author walking through Times Square** | Jennifer mid-stride, billboard(s) visible in the background. Candid energy, not posed. | Wider shot. Motion blur on passersby adds realism. |
| **Author portrait with billboard reflection** | Close-up of Jennifer, with the billboard composited into a reflection (window, sunglasses, or puddle). | Creative shot for social media and website hero sections. |
| **Author from behind** | Jennifer seen from behind, looking up at the billboard. Silhouette or semi-silhouette. | Powerful "moment of arrival" composition. |

**Author photo requirements:**

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Resolution | Minimum 4000 x 3000 px |
| Format | RAW + JPEG |
| Wardrobe | Sophisticated, dark or neutral tones — black, navy, deep plum. Nothing busy. Should read "author" not "tourist." |
| Hair / Makeup | Camera-ready, natural. Should match the energy of the book covers: grounded, present, powerful. |
| Lighting | Match the ambient lighting of the Times Square base images. If compositing, the lighting direction on Jennifer must match the scene. |
| Green screen option | If not shooting on-location, photograph Jennifer against a green screen or neutral backdrop with matched directional lighting for cleaner compositing. |

### 2C. Book Assets for Billboard Compositing

The designer will need finished book cover files to place onto the billboards.

| Asset | Format | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Vol 1 SEE front cover | High-res PNG (transparent background) or PSD | From cover designer deliverables |
| Vol 2 HEAL front cover | High-res PNG or PSD | From cover designer deliverables |
| Vols 3-8 covers (if available) | High-res PNG or PSD | From cover designer deliverables |
| Series lineup (all 8 spines) | High-res PNG | From cover designer deliverables |
| Series logo / wordmark | SVG or high-res PNG | "The Sovereignty Series" text treatment |
| Author name treatment | SVG or high-res PNG | "Jennifer Brooke Lawless" as designed for covers |
| QR code(s) | SVG or high-res PNG (transparent background) | See Section 5 |

## 3. Billboard Composite — Design Specifications

### 3A. How the Composite Works

The designer takes a real photograph of a Times Square billboard and replaces the existing advertisement with The Sovereignty Series book cover, matching the billboard's perspective, curvature, lighting, and ambient glow so the result looks like a real photograph of a real billboard.

### 3B. Billboard Layout Options

**Option A — Single Volume Feature**

The billboard displays one volume's cover art, enlarged and adapted for the landscape billboard format:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Option B — Book Cover as Hero**

The billboard shows a large 3D mockup of the physical book, angled, on a dark or branded background:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

**Option D — Author + Book**

The billboard features Jennifer's author photo alongside the book:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3C. Compositing Quality Standards

These standards ensure the final images are indistinguishable from real billboard photographs:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Perspective** | Book cover / billboard content must be perspective-warped to match the exact angle and curvature of the physical billboard in the photo |
| **Lighting** | Billboard content must match the ambient lighting. Daytime: muted, diffused. Nighttime: self-lit LED glow with light bleed onto surrounding surfaces |
| **Color temperature** | Match the color cast of the surrounding scene. Night shots have warm/cool mixed lighting from surrounding billboards |
| **Reflections** | On wet surfaces (rain, puddles), add a faint reflection of the billboard content |
| **Glow / bleed** | At night, LED billboards cast light onto nearby surfaces. Add subtle color bleed from the book cover colors onto adjacent buildings and pedestrians |
| **Edge treatment** | The billboard frame and structure must remain intact. Content sits inside the display area, not over the frame |
| **Grain / noise** | Match the noise profile of the base photograph. Digital billboard composites that are too clean look fake |
| **Atmospheric haze** | If the billboard is distant, apply appropriate atmospheric perspective (slight haze, reduced contrast) |
| **Pedestrians** | If people walk in front of the billboard in the base image, they must remain in front (layer order) |

### 3D. Recommended Compositing Tools

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| **Adobe Photoshop** | Primary compositing — perspective transform, lighting match, masking |
| **Adobe After Effects** | Video compositing — motion tracking billboards in video footage |
| **Blender** (free) | 3D perspective matching for complex curved billboard surfaces |
| **DaVinci Resolve** (free) | Video compositing alternative, color grading |
| **Mocha Pro** | Planar tracking for replacing billboard content in video |

---

## 4. Author Photography Composites

### 4A. Author + Billboard Composite Shots

These are the hero images of the campaign — Jennifer standing in Times Square with her billboard visible behind her.

**Composition approach:**

1. **On-location method** (preferred): Photograph Jennifer at the actual billboard location. Then composite the book cover onto the billboard in post-production. Jennifer is real in the scene; only the billboard content is altered.

2. **Full composite method**: Photograph Jennifer separately (against green screen or neutral background with matched lighting). Composite her into the Times Square scene along with the billboard content. Requires precise lighting match and shadow work.

**Key shots to produce:**

| Shot Name | Composition | Use |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **The Reveal** | Jennifer looking up at her billboard, shot from behind/side. Billboard large in frame. | Website hero, press kit |
| **The Arrival** | Jennifer walking toward camera, billboard visible over her shoulder. Street-level, candid. | Social media, about page |
| **Holding the Book** | Jennifer holding Vol 1 at chest height, cover facing camera. Billboard behind her shows the same cover, creating a visual echo. | Instagram, product pages |
| **The Lineup** | Jennifer standing center, with the series lineup billboard behind her showing all 8 covers. | Series landing page, Substack header |
| **The Close-Up** | Tight portrait of Jennifer, billboard bokeh-blurred but recognizable behind her. | Author bio, interviews, press |

### 4B. Author Holding Book — On-Location Shots

If Jennifer travels to Times Square for original photography:

**Shot list (no compositing needed for these):**

- Jennifer holding the book in front of a recognizable Times Square backdrop
- Jennifer reading the book on the TKTS red steps
- Jennifer standing at a crosswalk, book visible, Times Square signs behind
- Candid "street style" shots — walking, looking at book in hand, glancing up

**These shots are valuable even without billboard compositing** — they establish the author in the iconic location.

## 5. QR Code Integration

### 5A. What the QR Codes Link To

| QR Destination | URL | Purpose |
|----------------|-----|---------|
| **Free download** (primary) | Decoder Cards lead magnet landing page | Email list capture — the main funnel entry point |
| **Volume 1 purchase** | Amazon or Gumroad product page for SEE | Direct-to-purchase for impulse buyers |
| **Series landing page** | LightField.institute/books/sovereignty | Full series overview with all purchase options |
| **Linktree / link hub** | Single page with all key links | Catch-all: buy, subscribe, learn more, sessions |

**Recommendation:** Use the free Decoder Cards lead magnet as the primary QR destination. The QR code should feel like a gift ("Scan for a free toolkit"), not a sales pitch.

### 5B. QR Code Design Specifications

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Format** | SVG (vector) for infinite scaling, or PNG at minimum 1000 x 1000 px |
| **Error correction** | High (Level H / 30%) — allows partial obstruction and custom styling |
| **Color** | White on dark background, or series brand color. Must have sufficient contrast. Test scannability. |
| **Logo embed** | Optional — can embed a small series logo or "S" mark in the center if using high error correction |
| **Border** | Include the standard quiet zone (minimum 4-module white border) for reliable scanning |
| **Testing** | Every QR code must be tested on at least 3 devices (iPhone, Android, tablet) at the size it will appear in the composite |

### 5C. QR Code Placement on Billboard

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                                 │

│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Placement rules:**
- QR code should be in the lower-right quadrant of the billboard (natural scan position)
- Size should be at least 10% of the billboard height (must be scannable from a realistic distance in the photo)
- Include a short call-to-action next to the QR code: "Scan for your free Decoder Cards" or "Free toolkit — scan here"
- The QR code should be visually integrated — not just slapped on. Use a branded frame or subtle background shape
- In the composite, the QR code does not need to actually be scannable in the photo (it's a composited image). But it should look realistic and intentional.

---

## 6. Video Content

### 6A. Times Square Walkthrough Video

A short video (15-60 seconds) that simulates walking through Times Square and "discovering" The Sovereignty Series on the billboards.

**Concept:**

1. Camera moves through a crowd at street level in Times Square
2. Camera tilts up to reveal a billboard showing the SEE cover
3. Pan across to reveal a second billboard showing HEAL
4. Cut to wider shot showing multiple billboards with the series
5. Final shot: Jennifer standing in frame, looking up at her billboard, then turning to camera with a confident smile
6. End card: series logo + LightField.institute + QR code

**Production approaches:**

| Approach | Method | Quality |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Real footage + compositing** | Shoot video in Times Square, motion-track billboards, replace content in After Effects / Mocha Pro | Highest realism |
| **Stock footage + compositing** | License Times Square video footage, composite book covers onto billboards | High quality, lower cost |
| **AI-generated** | Use video AI tools to generate a Times Square walkthrough with custom billboard content | Emerging option, quality varies |
| **Mixed** | Real footage of Jennifer in Times Square + composited billboard content | Best balance of authenticity and control |

**Technical specifications for video:**

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Resolution | 4K (3840 x 2160) master, export 1080p for web |
| Frame rate | 24fps (cinematic) or 30fps (smooth) |
| Format | ProRes 422 or H.265 master; H.264 for web delivery |
| Color | Rec. 709 for web; grade to match the billboard lighting |
| Audio | Optional ambient Times Square sound (crowd, traffic) mixed low. No music required but cinematic underscore could elevate. |
| Duration | 15s (Instagram Reel / TikTok), 30s (website hero), 60s (full version) |

### 6B. Social Media Video Cuts

From the master video, create platform-specific cuts:

| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Duration | Format |
|----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Instagram Reel / TikTok** | 9:16 (vertical) | 15-30s | MP4, H.264 |
| **Instagram Feed** | 1:1 (square) or 4:5 | 15-30s | MP4, H.264 |
| **Instagram Story** | 9:16 | 15s | MP4, H.264 |
| **Website hero** | 16:9 (landscape) | 15-30s, looping | MP4, H.264 or WebM |
| **YouTube** | 16:9 | 30-60s | MP4, H.264 |
| **Substack embed** | 16:9 | 30-60s | MP4 or YouTube link |

### 6C. Animated Billboard Reveals

Short animations (5-10s) showing the book cover "appearing" on a billboard:

- **Fade-in reveal** — the billboard starts blank/dark and the cover fades in with a glow
- **Slide-in** — the cover slides into the billboard frame from one side
- **Pixel cascade** — the cover assembles pixel by pixel, LED-style
- **Transition** — a generic ad transitions to the book cover (as if the ad just changed)

These are useful for Instagram Reels, TikTok, and website micro-interactions.

### 7C. Website Gallery Component

Implement a "Times Square Campaign" gallery section with:

- **Lightbox behavior** — click to enlarge, swipe between images
- **Lazy loading** — images load as the user scrolls to them
- **Responsive grid** — 2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop
- **Caption overlay** — subtle captions on hover: "The Sovereignty Series in Times Square"
- **Video inline** — if video is included, it should autoplay muted on scroll, with a play button for full audio

### 7D. Suggested Page Section (Homepage)

```html
<!-- Times Square Campaign Section -->
<section class="times-square-campaign">
  <div class="section-header">
    <h2>The Sovereignty Series</h2>

## 9. Production Workflow

### Phase 1 — Gather Source Material

- [ ] Obtain or shoot high-resolution Times Square photographs (day and night)
- [ ] Photograph Jennifer (on-location in Times Square or green screen studio)
- [ ] Collect final book cover files from cover designer (high-res PNG / PSD)
- [ ] Generate QR codes for each destination URL
- [ ] Confirm QR codes are scannable on multiple devices

### Phase 2 — Create Billboard Composites (Photos)

- [ ] Select the strongest 3-5 billboard locations from source photos
- [ ] Composite Vol 1 (SEE) cover onto the primary billboard (day + night versions)
- [ ] Composite series lineup onto a wide billboard (day + night versions)
- [ ] Add QR code variants to selected composites
- [ ] Composite author into billboard scenes (if using full composite method)
- [ ] Review lighting match, perspective, grain, glow — iterate until photorealistic
- [ ] Produce "Author holding book" composites
- [ ] Produce "Author + billboard" composites for all key shots

### Phase 3 — Create Video Content

- [ ] Select or shoot video footage of Times Square
- [ ] Motion-track billboard surfaces in video footage
- [ ] Composite book covers onto tracked billboard surfaces
- [ ] Edit master video (30-60s walkthrough with billboard reveals)
- [ ] Cut platform-specific versions (Reel, Story, Feed, Hero loop, YouTube)
- [ ] Create animated billboard reveal clips (3-5 variations)
- [ ] Color grade all video to match across cuts
- [ ] Add optional ambient audio / music

### Phase 4 — Optimize for Website

- [ ] Export all photo assets in web-optimized formats (WebP + JPEG fallback)
- [ ] Export responsive versions (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- [ ] Create gallery thumbnails
- [ ] Export video in web-optimized formats (MP4 H.264, WebM)
- [ ] Create mobile-specific vertical video crops
- [ ] Prepare press kit package (high-res downloads)

### Phase 5 — Integrate into LightField.institute

- [ ] Add Times Square gallery section to homepage
- [ ] Add billboard composites to series landing page (/books/sovereignty)
- [ ] Add author billboard shots to about page
- [ ] Implement video hero (autoplay muted, lazy-loaded)
- [ ] Build press/media kit page with downloadable assets
- [ ] Test all assets across devices and browsers

## 10. Brand Consistency Reminders

All Times Square campaign assets must remain consistent with the established brand system:

| Element | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| **Typography** | Same font families as book covers (see `15-designer-brief.md`) |
| **Color palette** | Series accent color: orange-red `#E0522D`. Volume-specific palettes per brand guide. |
| **Series name** | "The Sovereignty Series" — always use full name |
| **Author name** | "Jennifer Brooke Lawless" — always use full name |
| **Website URL** | LightField.institute — this should appear on billboard composites |
| **Taglines** | Use only approved series taglines (see Brand Identity Guide) |
| **Tone** | Aspirational but grounded. Never flashy or salesy. The billboards should feel like a natural extension of the book's authority, not a gimmick. |

### Tone for Social Media Captions

When posting Times Square content, the tone should be:

- **Not:** "OMG my book is in Times Square!!!" (overhyped)
- **Not:** "Buy my book now!" (transactional)
- **Yes:** "Eight words. Eight books. One unveiling." (let the image speak)
- **Yes:** "The truth that was hidden in plain sight." (subtitle as caption)
- **Yes:** A personal reflection on the journey from writing to this moment (authentic, grounded)

## 11. Budget Considerations

### DIY / Low-Budget Approach

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Stock Times Square photos | $10-50 | Shutterstock, Adobe Stock. Ensure commercial + alteration license. |
| Photoshop compositing (self) | $0 (if already subscribed) | Requires strong Photoshop compositing skills |
| QR code generation | $0 | Free tools: qr-code-generator.com, qrcode-monkey.com |
| Video (stock footage + compositing) | $20-100 | Stock video + After Effects or DaVinci Resolve |

### Professional Approach

| Item | Estimated Range | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Times Square photography (hired) | $300-800 | NYC-based photographer, 2-hour shoot |
| Author photography (on-location NYC) | $500-1500 | Professional portrait photographer |
| Professional compositing (5-10 images) | $500-2000 | Freelance retoucher or compositor |
| Video production + compositing | $1000-5000 | Depends on complexity and length |
| Travel to NYC (author) | Variable | Flights, hotel, meals |

### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

1. Use licensed stock photography for Times Square base images
2. Photograph Jennifer locally (green screen or matching backdrop)
3. Hire a professional compositor for the final composites
4. Use stock video + AI-assisted motion tracking for video content

## 12. Legal Notes

- **Times Square buildings and billboards** — Photographs of public spaces in New York are legal for commercial use under the First Amendment. You are free to photograph and publish images of Times Square, including its buildings and billboard structures.
- **Existing billboard content** — You are replacing the existing content with your own, so no trademark issues arise from the composited result. However, if any recognizable brand logos remain visible on adjacent billboards in the background, consider whether they could imply an endorsement. When in doubt, blur or replace adjacent brand logos.
- **QR code destinations** — Ensure all QR code landing pages are live and functional before any campaign materials go public.
- **Stock photography licenses** — Verify that any stock images used allow commercial use, digital alteration, and publication. Some licenses restrict use in certain contexts (e.g., no use in "misleading" contexts). Read the license.
- **No false claims** — Do not imply that the series actually has or had a real Times Square billboard campaign unless one is purchased. Use these as marketing composites / conceptual campaign imagery. Framing as "campaign visuals" or "series promo art" is straightforward and honest.
